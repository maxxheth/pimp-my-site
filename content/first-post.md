# Welcome to My Hugo Site

This is my first post using Hugo with the Tailwind CSS theme. Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator built in Go.

## Features I Love About Hugo

- Lightning fast build times
- Flexible content management
- Simple deployment options
- Great theme ecosystem

## A Sample Code Block

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```
